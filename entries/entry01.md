# Entry 1
##### 11/08/2021 

  In this entry, I will discuss how I will be working/making for my SEP11 Freedom Project. I will express my ideas and present my plan for which tools currently interest me and what the project will be based on. I am thinking about illustrating the average water intake of mainly adults in the US and possibly how much intake of water a day is highly suggested, since it piqued my interest. I wanted to make this so people realize the importance of water and how most of their intake is small compared to the ideal. I personally drink so little water in a day and seeing this demonstration might motivate me to drink more water during the day. This is why I came to choose this particular subject for my freedom project. I will be using [D3](https://d3js.org/) for the particular project to make some kind fo chart/demographic of some kind. I chose to use D3 so that I can properly digest the codes I learn in my range, instead of cramming something out of my ability to keep up. Also, I wanted to make more of a visualization for my project. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) are the tools I considered at first and the idea was to make something that keeps track of your daily water intake and store the data. 
  
  I am on the very first step of the EDP(Engineering Design Process) which is defining the problem of my my project. I stated in the first paragraph of my ideas and showing my goal, intent and plan working towards the end of the project. I am thinking of how the data and tool will be a perfect pair for my type of project innovation. I am planning to dig deeper and research around my problem and move towards my goal in the next entry/step. 
 
  I learned the skill of problem decomposition by breaking down the importance of water intake(my topic). I brainstormed how I will utilize the data to put up the demonstration of average water intake in the US.I also thought about why it might be important for me as an individual and also just might partially help others through my project. I hope I can learn a lot more skills in the upcoming entries.
