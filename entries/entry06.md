## reflection & takeaways from elevator pitch at the expo
I learned a lot of things throughout this experience: presenting, tips, communication, time management, etc. When planning the pitch, I had to think about my time constraint and fitting all the information I want to include inside the 60 secs time interval. I learned how to successfully deliver a great elevator pitch and I got so many tips, tricks and what not to do during elevator pitches. The components that go into an elevator pitch is very interesting and complex. As this was my first experience of giving an elevator pitch, it was challenging; I did not know awhat exactly to include and to say when I am presenting my project along with it. I picked up knowledge that I should time myself, practice with it, and what kind of information is important in drawing the audience in. It was a great experience at the expo because it was something new to work with after a long break from in-person events and school.My main takeaways were: practice, be confident, manage, evaluate yourself in preparation for an elevator pitch paired with a presentation.

## reflection and takeaways from in-class presentation
I personally feel like I learned a lot from this in-class presentation. It taught me a lot of things about presentations. I got feedback about the presence, hook, the quality of the presentation and the interactivity about them. My presentation was not bad but it could simply just be bettered by improving my eye contact, presence, tone, the materials, which slide should come where for the attraction of the audience. It was really a great experience. I really enjoyed presenting in class because I got to showcase and explain in depth about my project and codes. The coordination of slides and explanations, more advice on presentations were things I really appreciate because it helped me present better than I could have in other clases. My main takeaways were that I could do more and manipulate my presentation to better my performance.

## EDP
I think my Engineering Design Process is at the end as I conclude my SEP11 course. Thus, I am at the very step 8 which is comunicating my results because I have, after all, presented and pitched my project to the judges, teacher and classmates. I have successfully finished creating my project final product and I proudly presented during the past weeks.

## skills
I learned growth mindset and attention to detail during the presentations. I learned to have patience with learning about presentations and a lot more. I also put a lot of attention to details in my presentation so I could deliver my content the most effectively. I learned to be patient and perservere through all this so that I can better my presentations in the future and be more successful at delivering my projects.
