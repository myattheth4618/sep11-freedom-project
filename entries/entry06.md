## reflection & takeaways from elevator pitch at the expo
I learned a lot of things throughout this experience: presenting, tips, communication, time management, etc. When planning the pitch, I had to think about my time constraint and fitting all the information I want to include inside the 60 secs time interval. I learned how to successfully deliver a great elevator pitch and I got so many tips, tricks and what not to do during elevator pitches. The components that go into an elevator pitch is very interesting and complex. As this was my first experience of giving an elevator pitch, it was challenging; I did not know awhat exactly to include and to say when I am presenting my project along with it. I picked up knowledge that I should time myself, practice with it, and what kind of information is important in drawing the audience in. It was a great experience at the expo because it was something new to work with after a long break from in-person events and school.My main takeaways were: practice, be confident, manage, evaluate yourself in preparation for an elevator pitch paired with a presentation.
