In this blog entry, I will be talking about how I have been learning about my tool and how I am planning to learn more during the break. I will be linking sources that helped me learn my tool for the freedom project which is d3.js. The first thing I did to start understanding the tool was to study the codes behind graphs and charts on [d3js.org](https://d3js.org/).
