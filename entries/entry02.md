In this blog entry, I will be talking about how I have been learning about my tool and how I am planning to learn more during the break. I will be linking sources that helped me learn my tool for the freedom project which is d3.js. The first thing I did to start understanding the tool was to study the codes behind graphs and charts on [d3js.org](https://d3js.org/). I looked at a lot of similar graphs, mainly bar graphs, based on my idea and also for inspiration. I started to look into the codes and started to see the terms used. I learned that `const` is used to assign almost like `var`, `.attr()` is used to add attributes, and that we need some html base to start coding using d3 and more. I looked at these graphs mainly because I am going for a similar visualization project as them, [graph 1](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart-transitions), [graph(s) 2](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot) & [graph 3](https://observablehq.com/@d3/histogram). I also started searching for videos on how to use and code in d3 and guides to making charts with my tool. One of the videos I watched on d3 is "[Building an interactive chart with D3.js](https://youtu.be/aHJCt2adSWA)" and it has been so helpful in helping me understand the different components of the graphs. The creator does a great job explainging and going through each of the parts and their functions, making it very easy for beginners to understand.
