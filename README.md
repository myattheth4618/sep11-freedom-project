# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Myat Thet Htut

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about creativity applied upon your interest. The purpose of this blog is to show my own interest and process throughout the whole year creating a product with the tool I chose. In my case, I chose water usage and the tool d3js and thus birthing a bar graph taht visualizes the numbers of gallons of water used in each household in America.

## Content
For my project, I am making a bar graph about water consumption in the US per household. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying the tool d3js in order to make the said bar graph that will contain different components of water that are used in an average American household.

## Implications
This project will help us see the water used and will help the society see the water they might have been wasting without noticing. This will help the economy and environment flourish because it will eliminate unnecessary waste of water and encourage saving water. This will be very useful because it is useful to me.
